# Convert Flash HTML Text

This ConvertText PHP class allows you to convert between Adobe Flash/Flex htmlText and html.

## About

When using an htmlText field in Flash or Flex (Flash Builder). Flash has its own way to define html text. Thats why [I](http://github.com/deslooverej) wrote this class to convert this htmlText to pure html that I can save in the database to use on my website.

## Work in progress

This class is under construction, but can do the work already.

## Documentation

The class is well documented inline. If you use a decent IDE you'll see that each method is documented with PHPDoc.

## Contributing

It would be great if you could help us improve this class. GitHub does a great job in managing collaboration by providing different tools, the only thing you need is a [GitHub](http://github.com) login.
